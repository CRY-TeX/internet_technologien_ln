### BOT TODO ###

- context
    -> context should just be array of BotResponse
    -> Elements should be accessible to all BotResponse's in the array
    -> There should be a hook where another BotResponse can interpet the data of another BotResponse
    -> context elements should probably be flagged as done once purpose is served

- there needs to be 

- different actions on different conditions
    -> for example different reaction if information is missing in context
       than when information is complete
    
    ==> Maybe actions need to be defined => interface for scraping ready response
        -> scrape chefkoch with that kind of information
        -> needs to be dynamically tied to the rest of the responses -> strategy pattern ?...
